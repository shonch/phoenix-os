# Phoenix Portfolio — Scripts

This folder contains executable emotional protocols—ritual scripts that honor thresholds, defend sovereignty, and reflect mythic identity.

## Structure

- `sleuthing/` — Investigative tools for emotional clues and symbolic echoes.
- `thresholds/` — Scripts that protect and log emotional thresholds and revelations.
- `defense/` — Protocols to override grind, fatigue, and impulsive collapse.
- `reflection/` — Mirrors to reflect emotional truth and mythic architecture.
- `launcher/` — phoenix.sh lives here, the ignition switch for your emotional OS.

Each script is a fragment of legacy. Each folder is a sanctuary of intent.
