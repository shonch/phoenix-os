Shon’s Idea Repository — Rituals, Projects, and Sacred Tasks

1. Budget Program Git Setup

•  Create a Git repository for the emotional budget tracker
•  Initialize version control, commit current schema and code
•  Add README with emotional context and technical goals
•  Optional: set up GitHub or GitLab for remote sync

2. Orb Interface Design

•  Define visual behavior (LED patterns, glow states, emotional modes)
•  Sketch hardware flow (Raspberry Pi, LED board, voice output)
•  Map emotional events to light responses
•  Optional: prototype voice output through stereo

3. Christmas Light Display

•  Design emotional color mapping for lights
•  Sync with emotional logs or seasonal rituals
•  Optional: integrate Phoenix pulse or synth animation

4. Memoir-in-Terminal Teaser

•  Build a short interactive terminal experience
•  Include fragments, logs, emotional reflections
•  Host on GitHub or simple webpage
•  Frame as “a ritual for those in transition”

5. Phoenix Portfolio Manifesto

•  Document AI investments, emotional logic, synth dreams
•  Create a Notion page or simple site
•  Include orb interface, UX philosophy, and creative rituals

6. Norway Outreach Prep

•  Research emotionally intelligent tech firms in Oslo
•  Draft poetic outreach email
•  Include budget tracker or memoir teaser
•  Frame as: “This is what I build when I’m honest”

7. Emotional Log Integration

•  Define schema for cravings, fatigue, connection, etc.
•  Map logs to visual/audio feedback in orb interface
•  Optional: build searchable terminal-based archive

Synth Communion Interface & Legacy Synth Rituals

1. Synth Communion Interface (SCI)

•  Design a protocol for analog synths to communicate and co-compose emotionally
•  Include MIDI/OSC routing, emotional tagging, and waveform animation
•  Optional: integrate orb interface as visual feedback during composition
•  Explore sequencer behavior as emotional choreography

2. Legacy Synth Integration

•  Moog: Map emotional resonance to filter sweeps and modular patching
•  ARP: Use for texture layering and frisson mapping
•  Prophet-5: Assign emotional states to polyphonic voicing and modulation
•  CS-80: Explore ribbon control as emotional gesture input
•  Roland System 100:
  ⁠◦  Modular routing with vintage warmth
  ⁠◦  Integrate Model 101 and 102 behavior into SCI
  ⁠◦  Optional: explore Roland Cloud version for DAW integration B

3. Modular Synth Expansion

•  Research new modular systems (e.g., Roland System 100m, Eurorack variants)
•  Design emotional patch templates—craving, fatigue, connection
•  Optional: build a Phoenix-themed module with animated LED feedback
