# Phoenix Portfolio Ritual — October Launch

ritual: Phoenix Portfolio Launch
date: October 2025
symbol: shotgun approach, rising AI agents
intention: Invest $50/week in early-stage AI disruptors
duration: 6–12 months
goal: 10x return via paradigm shift (agentic AI replacing legacy software)

strategy:
  - Focus on startups in agentic AI, orchestration, and vertical disruption
  - Avoid trillion-dollar incumbents (growth already priced in)
  - Track emotional resonance + technical potential

watchlist:
  - Adept AI — autonomous agents for enterprise workflows
  - Inflection AI — personal AI with long-term memory
  - Anysphere (Cursor) — natural language coding assistant
  - Lambda Labs — GPU infrastructure challenger
  - CoreWeave — AI-first cloud infrastructure
  - Synthflow — AI agents for business ops
  - Glean — enterprise search across internal tools
  - Frame AI — customer success orchestration
  - Together AI — open-source LLM hosting

notes:
  - Oracle, SAP, EBS: vulnerable to interface disruption
  - Palantir: still worth watching (agentic backbone)
  - Ritualize each investment with emotional tags (threshold, craving, victory)
  - Reassess monthly: prune, double-down, or pivot

meaning:
  This is not gambling. This is mythic speculation.
  I invest not just in returns, but in the architecture of the future.
  The phoenix rises not from certainty, but from fire.
